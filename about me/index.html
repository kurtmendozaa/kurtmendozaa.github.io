                <h1>About Me </h1>
                <p> My name is Kurt Mendoza and I am a student at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT) pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering. I am a highly motivated individual who is eager to apply my technical skills and knowledge in real-world scenarios.</p>
                <P>Ever since I was young, I have been fascinated with how technology works and how it can be used to solve complex problems. That's why I decided to pursue a career in computer engineering. At NAIT, I have had the opportunity to work on several projects that have allowed me to apply my knowledge and skills in practical ways. I have developed a strong foundation in programming, electronics, and computer architecture, and I am constantly working to expand my knowledge in these areas.</P>
                <P>In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with new technologies and building my own computer systems. I am also an avid gamer and love to spend my evenings exploring new worlds and solving puzzles. I believe that my passion for technology and my desire to constantly improve will help me achieve my goals and make a positive impact in the field of computer engineering</P>
                <p>In addition to my technical abilities, I am also a strong communicator and team player. I understand the importance of working well with others, and I believe that collaboration is key to success. I have been able to apply these skills in group projects, where I have learned how to effectively communicate with my team members and how to resolve conflicts.</p>
                <p>I am also a lifelong learner and am always seeking new opportunities to challenge myself and grow. I believe that education is a lifelong journey and that there is always room for improvement. I am constantly reading books, watching tutorials, and attending workshops to keep my knowledge and skills up-to-date.</p>
                <p>In my future career, I hope to use my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact in the world. I am particularly interested in developing technologies that can be used to address environmental and social challenges, such as renewable energy and access to education. I believe that technology has the power to make the world a better place, and I am determined to be a part of that change.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, I am a driven and motivated individual with a passion for technology and a desire to make a positive impact in the world. I am confident that my technical skills, communication abilities, and passion for learning will help me achieve my goals and make a valuable contribution to the field of computer engineering.</p>
